The Node package
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
helps you to prepare
[Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)
events with the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop) challenges
for different popular CTF frameworks. This interactive utility allows
you to populate a CTF game server in a matter of minutes.

## Setup ![node](https://img.shields.io/node/v/juice-shop-ctf-cli.svg) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/juice-shop-ctf-cli.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/juice-shop-ctf-cli.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli) ![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/juice-shop-ctf-cli.svg)

```
npm install -g juice-shop-ctf-cli
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Open a command line and run:

```
juice-shop-ctf
```

Then follow the instructions of the interactive command line tool.

### Configuration File

Instead of answering questions in the CLI you can also provide your
desired configuration in a file with the following format:

```yaml
ctfFramework: CTFd | FBCTF | RootTheBox
juiceShopUrl: https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
ctfKey: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/master/ctf.key # can also be actual key instead URL
countryMapping: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/master/config/fbctf.yml # ignored for CTFd and RootTheBox
insertHints: none | free | paid
insertHintUrls: none | free | paid # optional for FBCTF
insertHintSnippets: none | free | paid # optional for FBCTF
```

You can then run the generator with:

```
juice-shop-ctf --config myconfig.yml
```

Optionally you can also choose the name of the output file:

```
juice-shop-ctf --config myconfig.yml --output challenges.out
```

### Docker Container [![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf) [![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf) ![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf.svg) [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com") [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf "Get your own version badge on microbadger.com")

Share your current directory with the `/data` volume of your
`bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf` Docker container and run the interactive
mode with:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/data bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf
```

Alternatively you can provide a configuration file via:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/data bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf --config myconfig.yml
```

Choosing the name of the output file is also possible:

```
docker run -ti --rm -v $(pwd):/data bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf --config myconfig.yml --output challenges.out
```

- If using Docker Toolbox on Windows make sure that you also enable port
  forwarding for all required ports from Host `127.0.0.1:XXXX` to
  `0.0.0.0:XXXX` for TCP in the `default` VM's network adapter in
  VirtualBox. For CTFd you need to forward port `8000`.
